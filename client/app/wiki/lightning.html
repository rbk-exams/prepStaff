          <h3>Why Are We Doing This?</h3>
          <p>Being able to speak LOUDLY, CLEARLY, and CONFIDENTLY in front of an audience is a great life skill.
          As a software engineer, you need to be able to express your opinions and thoughts to your team. How should the architecture look like? What frameworks should you use? Why is this particular paradigm so important?</p>
          <p>Being able to express your views, tell a story, or teach is a skill all leaders need to have.</p>
          <h3>What Do I Do?</h3>
          <p>RBK Lightning Talks will happen <strong>after lunch every day</strong> starting next week.</p>
          <p>They must be 2-minutes minimum, 4 minutes maximum</p>
          <p>You can talk about any topic that you would like. But in our experience, non-technical lectures are always the best.</p>
