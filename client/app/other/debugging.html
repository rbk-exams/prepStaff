<h2>Debugging (or, Why Is Everything Broken?)</h2>
<p>
<br>
Debugging code in the browser is quite convenient, since all modern browsers come with a powerful debugger built right in. The debugger gives you the ability to pause the execution of your program, inspect the values of variables in real time, and even run new code in a live context if necessary. Leveraging those tools to analyze and determine the cause of unexpected behavior is the most essential programming skill you will ever learn.
Google Chrome, our browser of choice, has a great set of development tools that we'll dive into.
