<h1>The Chrome Console</h1>
<p>
We will be using the console a lot throughout this class, just like in the real world. Becoming familiar with using the console is extremely important.
 </p>
<h3>The JavaScript Environment</h3>
<p>
When we say environment, we do not mean the grass and trees around us. A programming environment is the set of processes and tools that we use to create software or program. It can also mean our physical environment, our computer, our chair, our keyboard, etc.
 
JavaScript is one of the three languages (and the only programming language) that power web pages on the Internet.
 
Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome are all web browsers. We use web browsers to view the content on the web pages.
 
Because web browsers are the tool that we use to see web pages, part of the web browser's functionality includes running JavaScript.
 
The most common (but not only) environment for running JavaScript is a web browser.
</p>
<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
<p> 
In this class, we will be using Google's Chrome browser. It can be downloaded here.
 
Chrome comes with a useful set of tools to help develop web pages, one of which is the JavaScript console. Google Chrome's developer console can be used to write and execute JavaScript code, and is a great place to experiment with the language.
</p> 

<h3>Opening the Console</h3>
<p>To open the console, use the keybinding for your system from within Chrome:</p><br>
<img src="images/chrom1.png" /> 

<p><br>
It is recommended that you learn to open the console from the keyboard, because we will be using it so frequently.

When you have the console open, it should look something like this:
</p><br>
<img src = "images/chrom2.png" />
