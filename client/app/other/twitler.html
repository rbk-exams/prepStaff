Build a Twitter clone using the power of JavaScript and HTML/CSS! A great opportunity to practice your newfound jQuery skills by building an interactive web application.
</p>	
 <p>First, You can access the repo for this coding assignment on GitHub by clicking
 <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3WzcJrq6yZRQlkyNEJTUEQ0UWM">this link</a> and downloading it</p>

<h3>What's Already Here</h3>
<p>This is a mostly-empty repo, with a file that creates some data that represents twitter users and their tweets. It's the data you would expect to see if you had created a twitter account and followed a few people. (More tweets appear over time.)
</p>
<p>That file is called data_generator.js. You don't need to understand the code that's in it, but here's what it does:<br>
Creates two global variables, users and streams.
<ul>
<li><p>users is an array of strings -- all the usernames that you're following.</p></li><br>
<li><p>streams is an object with two properties, users and home.</p></li><br>
<li><p>streams.home is an array of all tweets from all the users you're following.</p></li><br>
<li><p>streams.users is an object with properties for each user.streams.users.shawndrost has all of shawndrost's tweets.
Kicks off a periodic process that puts more data in streams.</p></li><br>
</ul>
<p>You'll mostly be working in the javascript block of index.html.<br> Note: The generated tweets will be displayed in reverse chronological order.
</p>
<h3>Bare Minimum Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Show the user new tweets somehow. (You can show them automatically as they're created, or create a button that displays new tweets.)</p></li>
<li><p>Display the timestamps of when the tweets were created. This timestamp should reflect the actual time the tweets were created, and should not just be hardcoded.</p></li>
<li style="color: red"><p>Fill the following survey INDIVIDULLY, you can read the passage (in the survey) in pairs, but make sure you fill the survey individully, we trust that each one will answer on his own<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/cegwVUgccV85wjhY2"> HERE</a></p></li>
<li><p>Design your interface so that you want to look at and use the product you're making.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the user to click on a username to see that user's timeline.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Show when the tweets were created in a human-friendly way (eg "10 minutes ago"). You'll want to find and use a library for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the user to tweet. (This is going to require you to understand a little more about data_generator.js, but you shouldn't need to modify anything.)</p></li>
</ul>
