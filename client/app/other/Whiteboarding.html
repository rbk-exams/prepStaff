          <h2 id="interviewer-advice">Interviewer Advice</h2>
          <p>The interviewer is very important--you are here to support your partner and help them improve.</p>
          <p>Here are some tips to make sure this is fun!</p>
          <h4 id="be-respectful">Be Respectful</h4>
          <p>Whiteboarding can be stressful and scary for some people. Do not make it worse.</p>
          <h4 id="don-t-give-the-answer">Don&#39;t Give The Answer</h4>
          <p>You want your partner to exercise his/her brain! It is no fun if you give the answer.</p>
          <p><strong>Finding the answer is not the most important part of whiteboarding.</strong></p>
          <p>Let me say it again.</p>
          <h3 id="finding-the-answer-is-not-the-most-important-part-of-whiteboarding-">Finding the answer is not the most important part of whiteboarding.</h3>
          <p>Okay?</p>
          <p>The most important part is HOW the person thinks about the problem. What kind of questions do they ask? How do they think?</p>
          <p>That is much more important than the answer.</p>
          <h3 id="ask-for-clarification-frequently">Ask For Clarification Frequently</h3>
          <p>This means, ask your partner a lot of questions.</p>
          <p>Make sure your partner explains what they are doing, even if you understand.</p>
          <p>Ask them to explain what they are doing, each step.</p>
          <p>Examples:</p>
          <p>&quot;Why are you writing a for loop?&quot;
          &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;
          &quot;What are some edge cases?&quot;</p>
          <p>Make sure your partner is talking! <strong>Don&#39;t let there be long silences.</strong></p>
          <h3 id="don-t-be-controlling">Don&#39;t Be Controlling</h3>
          <p>Be careful not to do too much. You need to know when to allow your partner to continue. But if they are struggling too much...</p>
          <h3 id="reduce-struggling">Reduce Struggling</h3>
          <p>If your partner is having a hard time, please <span class="definition" title="تدخل"intervene</span>.</p>
          <p>Ask them to explain what they have done so far.
          Give them a hint where they can look.
          If they mentioned an idea earlier, remind them about it.
          Ask them a question that you think will help them.</p>
          <h3 id="leave-time-for-review">Leave Time for Review</h3>
          <p>Make sure you spend a few minutes after talking to your partner about how it went.</p>
