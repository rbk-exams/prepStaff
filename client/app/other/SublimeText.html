<h1>Getting Started with Sublime Text</h1>
<h3><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>
The console is a great tool for experimentation, and we are going to continue to use it throughout the class; however, it has some limitations:
 
Ephemeral: All the code you enter into the console goes away! You cannot keep it around after you close your browser. You also cannot refer back to something you wrote a while ago.
Poor Editing Capability: The console is not very good at helping you to write code that is multiple lines. We need something that is easier to write more code in.
First, please install Sublime Text 3 if you do not have it. Please do this first before the below.
</p>

<h2>Starter Project</h2>
<p>
We provide a starter project that you can use for most days' exercises. You can get it by following these instructions:
 
<a href="../rp-starter-master.zip" download>Right click here</a> and select "Save Link As..." to save the archive somewhere, e.g your desktop.
<br><br>
<b>Next</b>, unarchive the folder inside (can usually be done by just double-clicking) and rename the new folder something like "day1".
 <br><br>
open starter project
 <br><br>
<b>Now</b>, complete the following steps:
 <br><br>
Open the folder you renamed.
Open <b>main.js</b> file in Sublime Text (again, you may need to right click). You should see the following in the file:</p><br>
<p style="color: #8E0D56;">
		function square(x) {<br>
            return x * x; <br>
        }
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
Open the index.html file in Google Chrome (you may need to right click and "Open With..."). You should see a page open in your browser that says Welcome! at the top.
Open a console in the Welcome HTML page. Type square(10) into the console and hit Enter -- 100 should be the result. If so, everything's working!
