          <h2 id="what-we-look-at">What We Look At</h2>
          <p>  We will not compare your project to someone else&#39;s project. We will look at
            how much progress you have made and if you push yourself.</p>
          <p>  Do you only stay with things that you are comfortable with?
            Do you try to learn more?</p>
          <p>  This is a chance for you to think about what you really want to make and to try to make it!</p>
