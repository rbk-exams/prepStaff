	<h1>Introduction to Automated Testing</h1>
	<p>The primary difficulty in software engineering is proving that code does what it is supposed to do, especially after many conflicting changes. Automated testing is a tool which is used widely in the industry to specify and improve code.</p>
<p>An automated test is just a special program that runs to verify that the main program is doing what you expect, and throws a noisy error otherwise. For example, if we've written a function isDivisibleByTwo, we could write a test function that checks that 4, 50, and 2^30 all return true, and 3, 151, and 2^30-1 all return false.</p>

<p>We've fully embraced automated testing as part of our core curriculum, and much of our coursework involves test suites which specify the behavior of the code you and your pair will be writing. Don't worry too much about writing your own tests, for now; you'll get your hands dirty with this during the course. This section will simply give you a first taste of test-assisted learning.</p>
<h1>TestBuilder</h1>
<p>An interactive introduction to software testing and your first exposure to <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>, a popular JavaScript testing suite.</p>

<h2>Before Moving On</h2>
<p>Be comfortable with basic testing syntax such as describe, it, expect, eql, equal.<br>
Understand the purpose of an expectation or assertion, and what it means for a test to fail.
Feel comfortable with being given a failing test, and making it pass.
Ensure all tests are passing for the Bare Minimum Requirements for the Koans repo and that your work has been pushed to your fork on github</p>
<h2>JavaScript Koans</h2>
<p>First download this file by clicking <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3WzcJrq6yZRNGxHVFQtOXpUNUE
">here</a></p>
<p>A hands-on re-introduction to JavaScript syntax, and your first opportunity to work within a test suite. The Koans use Jasmine, a popular alternative which is largely interchangeable with Mocha.</p>

<p>The goal of the Javascript koans is to teach you Javascript programming through testing.
<br>
When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a stack trace indicating where the error occurred. Your goal is to make the error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about the Javascript language and functional programming in general.
<br><br>
Your journey towards Javascript enlightenment starts in the koans/AboutExpects.js file. These koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through more koans, more and more Javascript syntax will be introduced which will allow you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.
</p>
<h3>Bare Minimum Requirements:</h3>
<p>Make all tests in these files pass:<br>
AboutExpects.js<br>
AboutArrays.js<br>
AboutFunctions.js<br>
AboutObjects.js</p>
<h3>Extra credit:</h3>
<p>Make the rest of the tests pass.<br>
You shouldn't need to write any Jasmine code, but if you'd like to know more, check out their <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">docs.</a></p>

<h2>Running the Koans from a Browser</h2>
<p>Simply navigate to the Koans folder using a file browser, and double click on KoansRunnner.html.

Any browser will do, but for the best results Firefox or Chrome is recommended. More stack trace information shows up for javascript on these browsers.

The first error will be in koans/AboutExpects.js. Fix the first test and refresh the browser. Rinse and repeat until all tests turn green.

The test runner used is <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html">Jasmine </a>with a customized report viewer.
